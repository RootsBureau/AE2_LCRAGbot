I was lucky enough to work with him at\\ndc1ab on several projects. Andrey knows how to dive into a project head-on and competently manage\\ndevelopment priorities, not missing a single detail, but at the same time leaving room for creativity for\\ncreative team members. He is one of the most hardworking delivery guys I have encountered in my\\nentire career, and if the adjective \"talented\" can be added to \"delivery\", then this is definitely about\\nAndrey.\\nHe knows how to not only lead projects, facilitate with ease and elegance, but also manage the\\nexpectations of all participants, linking business requests with production capabilities. Soft skills of at\\nleast a demigod level allow him to establish relationships with team members, motivate and, if\\nnecessary, give impulse in the form of a metaphorical kick in the ass - always with a smile, always\\neasy going and professional.\\nI often hear about people who burn out on long projects, and sometimes I even observe them, but\\nAndrey, in my opinion, is from the cohort of people who are fireproof, and he knows how to spread this\\nquality, like an aura, to the team members. A true paladin of light, or a gifted necromancer -\\ndepending on who the team consists of. At the same time, in conditions of limited resources, he\\nknows how and, most importantly, loves to work with his hands when necessary - today,\\nunfortunately, this is a great rarity.\\nA company that decides to hire him will undoubtedly be lucky, because it will receive at its disposal a\\ncheerful manager with deep product knowledge, who makes balanced decisions and always brings\\nthings to an end. Most often, this ending, by the way, is happy.\\nlinkedin.com/in/evgeny-sister-9b171892/\\nfbeaster@gmail.com\\n+37491543506\\nMarch 20, 2025\\nEvgeny Sister\\nProducer of Beholder \\nProducer - Gaijin Entertainment\\nSincerely,\\nLetter of\\nRecommendation\\nEvgeny Sister'),\n",
